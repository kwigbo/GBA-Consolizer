## Files

* **Motherboard Mount**
	* [Inserts Version - /Models - Inserts/Motherboard Mount](Models%20-%20Inserts/Motherboard%20Mount)
	* [No Inserts Version - /Models - No Inserts/Motherboard Mount](Models%20-%20No%20Inserts/Motherboard%20Mount)

## Printing Details

**Print the model flat side down. There is a difference as one side has to clear the components on the GBA board.**

* No supports
* 0.2mm layer height

## Brass Inserts

**Four M2x8 brass inserts are need for this part if printing the inserts version.**

**IMPORTANT!: Make sure all matting surfaces (top and bottom) are flush when installing the inserts. Any globs of plastic will affect the final fitment. A razor blade can help especially right after install before the plastic has cooled.**
