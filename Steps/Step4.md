**IMPORTANT!: Make sure all matting surfaces (top and bottom) are flush when installing the inserts. Any globs of plastic will affect the final fitment. A razor blade can help especially right after install before the plastic has cooled. Refer the the image below when installing. Two post will remain empty and are a passthrough hole for screws in another step.**
