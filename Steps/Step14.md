# STEP 14 - Amiibo Holder

**[< -- Go Back](../README.md)**

**This is not guaranteed to fit all Amiibo. The concept is pretty simple though and Amiibo specific versions are not to difficult to create.**

## Files

* [Top Clip Full](../Models/Amiibo_Top_Clip_Full.3mf)
* [Top Clip Notched](../Models/Amiibo_Top_Clip_Notched.3mf)

## Parts Needed
* 1x Holder Post Variant
* 2x Holddown Pins
* 2x Top Clips
* 1x Decorative Ring
* 1x Holder Tray

**Push the Holder Post into the Holder Tray and install in the lid of the consolizer with the two Holddown Pins. Slide the Decorative Ring over the Holder Tray and place an Amiibox in the tray. Use the Holddown Pins to secure the Amiibo in place. The Notched variety helps when there are small pieces of the Amiibo that go beyond the bounds of the tray.**
