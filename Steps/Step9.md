# STEP 9 - Face Plate

**[< -- Go Back](../README.md)**

**Print the Face Plate face down. Print the button with the narrow side down.**

**Place the button in the Face Plate and gently rest the tabs over the Catridge Tray Holes. Flip it over and gently pull the bottom of the Face Plate over the SNES port. It should fit right in with possibly a slight click into place (See Image Face Plate A and B).**

**Check that the button clicks easy and does not stick. Check that the Face Plate sits flush against the SNES port.**

**Use two M2x10 screws through both the Face Plate and the Cartridge Tray to secure both (See Image Face Plate C).**
