# STEP 7 - Frame Assembly (Gamebox)

**[< -- Go Back](../README.md)**

## Step 1 - Consolizer Mounts

**Attach the Consolizer Mounts to the Motherboard Mount. The flat sides should go together. There are four screws that pass through the Consolizer Mounts into the four points on the Motherboard Mount. See image below for details.**

## Parts

* **4 - M2x8 Screws**

## Step 2 - Board Adpaters

**Attach the Board Adapters to the Consolizer Mounts. The flat sides go together. See image below for proper orientation. The front Consolizer Mount screws should get covered in this step.**

## Parts

* **4 - M2x8 Screws**

## Step 3 - GBHD Board

**Attach the GBHD board to the Board Adapters with the components facing up towards the Motherboard Mount. The ports should face the rear, which is the wider side of the Motherboard Mount.**

## Parts

* **4 - M3x6 Screws**

## Step 4 - Support Bar

**Attach the display ribbon cable to the front of the GBA motherboard (Image 4a). Make sure the ribbon is seated fully (Image not seated to show orientation of the cable). Rest the GBA motherboard on the frame as pictured below (Image 4b) and feed the CPU ribbon into the frame. Install the Support Bar. See Image 4B for support bar orientation.**

## Parts

* **2 - M3x8 Screws**

## Step 5 - GBA Motherboard

**Gently place the GBA motherboard on the Motherboard Mount and attach with the two screws to the back of the console. The front two screw will remain empty for now as they are used for the faceplate attachment.**

**Note: The display ribbon should go between the GBA Motherboard and the Motherboard Mount in the small space created. See Step 5b image below.**

## Parts

* **2 - M2x6 Screws**

## Step 6 - Display Cable

**Gently tuck the display ribbon cable under the GBA motherboard. Hold it at the font where it attaches to stop it from pushing out the front.**

## Step 7 - CPU Cable

**One of the trickies parts is to attach the CPU ribbon cable to the GBAHD board. If bent correctly you should be able to wiggle it into place.**

**Note: I will probably get some more of these and figure out alternate folds that works better. I only had one and didn't want to bend it too much. You may have to unmount the GBAHD board from the bottom to plug it in.**

## Step 8 - Test

**The console should now be functional and it's a good idea to test it at this point before continuing. You can always temporaily attach the front of the GBA board with 2 - M2x6 Screws just to hold it securly during testing.**
