## Step 3 - GBA Motherboard

**Gently place the GBA motherboard on the Motherboard Mount and attach with the two screws to the back of the console. The front two screw will remain empty for now as they are used for the faceplate attachment. See Step 3a image below.**

**Note: The display ribbon should go between the GBA Motherboard and the Motherboard Mount in the small space created. The cables should feed down through the Consolizer Mounts on each side. See Step 3b image below.**

## Step 5 - Test

**The console should now be functional and it's a good idea to test it at this point before continuing. You can always temporaily attach the front of the GBA board with 2 - M2x6 Screws just to hold it securly during testing.**
