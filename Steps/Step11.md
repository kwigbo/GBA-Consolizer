**[< -- Go Back](../README.md)**

**This is a multi-part model but is printed as one piece. The floor is a seperate piece so it can be printed as an infill pattern with zero top layers and zero bottom layers. ( Might be Prusa Slicer only? )**

## Parts

* **2 - M3x8**

## Files

* [Consolizer Shell](../Models%20-%20Common/Consolizer%20Shell.3mf)

## Printing Details

* No supports
* 0.2mm layer height

**Slide the assembled console frame into the Consolizer Shell. There are alignment posts to help put it in the right position. It should slip right in. Connect the frame to the shell with the two M3x8 SCrews from the bottom ( See images below ).**
